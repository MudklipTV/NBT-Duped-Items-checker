# NBT-Duped-Items-checker.
A lightweight 1.8.9 Minecraft Forge Mod for Hypixel Skyblock which adds a Duped item checker to Hypixel Skyblock.
This is very important if you are late game (or early game) and you are buying/trading an item and want to know if it is duped or not.

# What it does:
This mod adds High-Value Dupe checker into your skyblock experience.
It uses the NBT data from past dupes to find out if items are duped.

# NBT Dupe Checker Download:
A side mod of Skytils/Sbe, An amazing Dupe Checker. although SBE and Skytils are better in different aspects, NBT is better overall for dupe checking, as Skytils and SBE's api lacks in quality. Skytils and SBE use a public api while the Duped Item Checker Mod uses a public and private api which can detect more dupes.
